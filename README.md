### 🏄🏼‍♂️Caio Zimbardi 

**Web Developer (Full Stack)**

As an experienced customer service representative, I've always had a knack for problem-solving and critical thinking. Those skills, combined with my passion for technology, led me to complete Le Wagon's coding bootcamp in Berlin and transition into web development. 

I am driven by a passion for learning and innovation, and I constantly seek out new challenges to push myself to grow and excel.

Throughout my bootcamp at Le Wagon, I gained hands-on experience with Ruby, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript ES6, CSS, Bootstrap, HTML and PostgreSQL, as well as a collaborative workflow using Git and GitHub until deployment with Heroku.
